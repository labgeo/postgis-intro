The archive named *municipalities.tar.lz* contains a cartographic generalization (*municipios.shp*) of the ETRS89 polygons of spanish municipalities from Albacete, Alicante, Murcia and Valencia provinces provided by the Spanish Center for Geographic Information (CNIG) in its National Reference Geographic Equipment (EGRN).  
Thus, this is a derivative work from data which is property of the Spanish National Geographic Institute (IGN). Source data can be downloaded from the CNIG download center at http://centrodedescargas.cnig.es/CentroDescargas/ . Source metadata is included along with this derivative work.  
EGRN data is considered public domain and can be freely used provided that the copyright holder (IGN - Spanish National Geographic Institute) is mentioned.  
Generalization has been performed using OpenJUMP's Simplify Polygon Coverage tool. This tool is an implementation of the Douglas-Peucker algorithm that keeps 3rd degree nodes unmodified and tries to avoid boundaries overlapping. A simplification tolerance of 0.0004 was used in just one single iteration. This shapefile may be unsuitable for spatial analysis purposes. Be warned that topology preservation has not been checked and, therefore, cannot be guaranteed.
